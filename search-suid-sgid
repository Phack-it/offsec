SUID and SGID files on your system are a potential security risk, and should be monitored closely. 
Because these programs grant special privileges to the user who is executing them, it's necessary to ensure that insecure programs are not installed. 
A favorite trick of crackers is to exploit SUID-root programs, then leave a SUID program as a back door to get in the next time, even if the original hole is plugged.

If you need to find files that have their SUID or SGID bit set, do this.

Find all SUID root files:
find / -user root -perm -4000 -print
 
Find all SGID root files:
find / -group root -perm -2000 -print
 
Find all SUID and SGID files owned by anyone:
find / -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 -print
 
Find all files that are not owned by any user:
find / -nouser -print
 
Find all files that are not owned by any group:
find / -nogroup -print
 
Find all symlinks and what they point to:
find / -type l -ls
